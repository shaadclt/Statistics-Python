# Statistics Concepts Practice using Python

This project provides a collection of Jupyter Notebook exercises for practicing statistics concepts using Python. Statistics is a fundamental field in data analysis and plays a crucial role in understanding and interpreting data. Through this project, we aim to enhance our statistical skills by implementing various concepts using Python and gaining hands-on experience with real-world datasets.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (3.x)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- SciPy
- StatsModels

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shaadclt/Statistics-Python.git
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd Statistics-Python
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

4. Run Jupyter Notebook:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

5. Open the Jupyter Notebook files (*.ipynb) in Jupyter.

6. Follow the instructions in the notebooks to practice and explore different statistics concepts using Python.

## Project Overview

The project covers various statistics concepts, including but not limited to:

1. Descriptive Statistics: Computing measures such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation.
2. Probability Distributions: Working with different probability distributions, such as normal, binomial, or Poisson distributions.
3. Correlation and Regression: Exploring relationships between variables and performing linear regression analysis.


Each notebook includes code snippets, and practice exercises to reinforce the understanding of statistics concepts using Python.

## Results and Insights

The emphasis of this project is on practicing and implementing statistics concepts rather than providing specific results or insights. Each notebook contains exercises and examples to apply the concepts learned and gain a deeper understanding of statistical analysis using Python. Feel free to experiment with different datasets, modify the exercises, or explore additional statistical concepts beyond the provided exercises.

## Customization

You can customize the project by adding your own datasets, creating additional notebooks for specific topics, or expanding the exercises with more advanced statistical concepts. This project serves as a starting point for you to practice and enhance your statistical skills using Python.
